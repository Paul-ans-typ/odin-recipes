      <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or smoked paprika (½ tsp for less

      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala (½ tsp more if needed, adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Whole spices (omit if you don't have)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 bay leaf or 1 sprig curry leaves</li>
      <li>4 cloves</li>
      <li>2 inch cinnamon piece</li>
      <li>3 green cardamom</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        On a medium flame, heat oil in a deep pan. Add the whole spices – bay
        leaf, cinnamon, cloves & green cardamoms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the chopped onions and chilies. Saute until deep golden in
        color, for 7 to 8 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ginger garlic paste and saute till you get a nice aroma, for about a
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then add tomatoes, turmeric and salt. Mix well and cook until the
        tomatoes turn soft & mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn down the heat to low, Stir in the yogurt (or cashew paste), red
        chili powder, garam masala & coriander powder.
      </li>
      <li>Cook on low heat, until the mixture smells good and aromatic.</li>
      <li>
        Add chicken and coriander leaves. Fry on a medium heat till the chicken
        turns white or pale in color. This takes around 3 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook on a low heat for 3 to 4 minutes. This step is very
        important as the chicken absorbs all the flavors of the spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile in a separate pot, heat up 1 cup water. Using cold water most
        times toughens the chicken so it is good to use hot water.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to make Chicken Curry</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour hot water just enough (about ½ cup) to make a thick gravy. As you
        cook, chicken lets out plenty of moisture, depending on that add more
        water. Check the pictures in the post for consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook on a medium flame till the chicken is soft cooked and the
        curry/gravy turns thick. When the chicken is cooked completely it will
        fall off the bone easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the curry & add more salt if needed. You can also add another ½
        tsp garam masala at this stage if you feel it is less in flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly garnish with coriander leaves, cover and off the heat. Serve
        chicken curry with butter naan or jeera rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You leave out the whole spices if you do not have. But they add a more
        intense flavor to the curry.
      </li>
      <li>
        To prevent yogurt from splitting, add it to a bowl and whisk it well
        with a fork. Add 2 tbsps of onion tomato masala (made in the recipe) and
        mix it well with yogurt. Then lower the flame completely and pour the
        yogurt to the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        To substitute yogurt, use 1.5 tbsps cashew butter or soak 12 cashew nuts
        or almonds or 3 tablespoons of white poppy seeds in half cup water for
        30 minutes. Later blend it with 4 to 6 tablespoons water in a small
        grinder to make super smooth milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don’t like chunky curry with onions and tomatoes then blend the
        onion tomato masala with half cup water in a blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding cold water to chicken sometimes makes it hard or tough. So use
        hot water.
      </li>
      <li>
        This chicken curry can be cooked in coconut milk instead of water. Do
        not pour cold coconut milk. Heat up and add.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please choose a good garam masala for the recipe especially if using
        store bought. Some brands sell really pungent garam masala. Use it with
        caution.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also use 3 to 4 tbsps of cream or thick coconut milk towards the
        end if you prefer. Just add it towards the end and turn off.
      </li>
    </ol>
