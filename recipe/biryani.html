    <h3>How to make Chicken Biryani</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat ghee or oil in a pot or pressure cooker.</li>
      <li>
        Add whole spices – bay leaf, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, star anise,
        shahi jeera & mace. Skip them if you do not have.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the spices begin to sizzle, add onions & fry them evenly stirring
        often until uniformly light brown but not burnt.
      </li>
      <li>Add chicken & saute until pale for 5 mins on a medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cover & cook on a low flame until the chicken is soft cooked or tender.
        Saute to evaporate any excess moisture in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste test and add more salt if needed. Add yogurt (curd), half of the
        chopped mint leaves, slit green chili, red chili powder & garam masala.
      </li>
      <li>
        ½ to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 green chili, ¼ cup plain yogurt, 1
        teaspoon garam masala
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Layering</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix everything well and layer chicken evenly at the bottom. (check
        video)
      </li>
      <li>Spread drained rice in a layer over the chicken.</li>
      <li>
        To a separate pot, pour water. If cooking in a pot use more water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt and mix. Taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Bring this
        to a rolling boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 cups of this hot water across the sides of the cooker or pot.
        Gently pour the rest on top of the rice. (check video)
      </li>
      <li>
        Level the rice if needed. Sprinkle the rest of the mint leaves.
        Optionally add fried onions & saffron soaked milk if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pot method – If cooking in a pot, cover and cook on a medium flame until
        the rice in the chicken biryani is cooked completely but not mushy or
        undercooked. (Takes me 15 mins, from the time the water boils in the
        pot, may be different for you). If the rice is still under cooked or
        hard & there is no water at the bottom, pour ¼ to ½ cup more boiling
        water depending on the kind of rice used and cook further. When done it
        has to be fully cooked, yet remain grainy but not mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooker method – Set the flame to medium high. Cover & place the whistle.
        Cook until you hear 1 whistle. Move the cooker away from the burner to
        stop cooking further.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve from top to the bottom layer. Each serving gets biryani rice from
        top and chicken from the bottom layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy chicken biryani with raita and sliced veggies, papad and shorba
        (biryani gravy).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Water: The amount of water to use depends on the brand of basmati rice.
        Not all basmati rice need the same amount of water. So for pot method,
        start with 3 cups water. Towards the end if the rice is undercooked,
        pour ¼ to ½ cup boiling water and cook further. You will need to
        experiment a bit with the right amount here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomatoes: An authentic biryani never uses tomatoes, so I have not used
        in the recipe. It does not add any taste infact alters the flavor. If
        you still want to use you an follow the second recipe I have posted
        below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yogurt or curd: Do not use sour curd. If the curd is slightly sour then
        skip using lemon juice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rice: I have used lalquilla basmati rice, old malai. Any other basmati
        rice may need less or more water. Make sure to use as needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
